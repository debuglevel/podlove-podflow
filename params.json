{"name":"Podflow","tagline":"[experimental] a plugin for podlove to automate the workflow of processing and publishing a podcast episode","body":"### What is Podflow?\r\nPodflow is a @Podlove plugin to make it as easy as possible to publish new Podcast episodes.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nIt just brings together two really great tools: Podlove and Auphonic.\r\nHave a look on this short video to see Podflow in action: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSxsbvxdRpE (unfortunately only available in german)\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nI actually do not know, if I will continue developing the plugin.\r\nI guess the podlove team wants develop its own podflow-alike tool in the future. Therefore, podflow is rather a temporary solution, and I'm looking forward to the development of podlove which will probably create an way better solution than Podflow is at the moment.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n* @timpritlove and @eteubert for Podlove.\r\n* Holgi for the lulz","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
